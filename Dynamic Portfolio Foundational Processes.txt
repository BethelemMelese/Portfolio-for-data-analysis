For this Dynamic Portfolio Founcation Process, I use MERN Stuck
 So, to make it, First need to install Node.js, Mongodb, Express.js, React with TypeScript because we will use for React Ts for Frontend page and use Visual Studio text editor (I recommanded),

The Steps I followed,
- first installing the package.json, using this command "npm init -y",
- create new "index.js" file in the root folder
- Then to run it use this command "node index.js" but to make more clean add ""serve": "node index.js"" in package.json, then after start "npm run dev"
- Then install the express.js using "npm i express",
- Then install npm i nodemon -D to make the development process live and add "dev":"nodemon index.js" in package.json

The Setpes for FrontEnd
- First install npx create-react-app client-side -template typescript..... this will create react project including TypeScript
- Then install the nessasary framework like Material UI and Ant Design plus route-dom for the routing purpose so to make this use the below command
   Material UI: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
   Ant Design: npm install antd --save
   React Route Dom: npm i react-router-dom
- Then start Coding

N.B: In Typescript every class component has to be started with capital letter otherwise, you will get error so make sure that.
