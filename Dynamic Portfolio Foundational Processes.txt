For this Dynamic Portfolio Founcation Process, I use MERN Stuck
 So, to make it first need to install Node.js, Mongodb, Express.js for backend and, React TypeScript for Frontend, plus use Visual Studio text editor (I recommanded),

The Steps I followed,
- first installing the package.json, using this command "npm init",
- then install the express.js and other based on the commands:
    1, Create two folder one for react part which is frontend and call it client or client-side and the other folder for Express, Node and Mongodb which is backend
=> then make the below in the server-side foleder by using cd server-side
   1, npm install express
   2. Create tsconfig.json file in the main diroctory for ensures TypeScript compiles your code according to these settings, 
       facilitating seamless integration with your projectâ€™s requirements.
   3. Create .eslintrc.json also in the main dirctory for specifies ESLint settings for TypeScript files
   4. npm i dotenv mongoose, to installing and setting up MongoDB and other necessary packages
=> then make the below to create the client-side or client-side 
   5. Add react to this project for frontend npx create-client-side client-side --template typescript
   6. add the typescript with react in this project
   7. then setup the project folder structure because, a project folder structure is an essential part of any project.
   8. after all done push to the remore repository and create new branch for the next development proress, this helps to manage the all development process
